# LearningEnglishApp
App under development.

## Brief description

Firstly, the app will only have one functionality named "FLASHCARDS". This functionality consist onshowing differents words, whith you think that are difficult for you, and try to guess the meaning. If you do not find the corrent solution you will be able to swap the card to show the correct solution.

## Motivations

Many people think that the use of flash cards is such a good method to memorise vocabulary, so I will try to addapt this idea into a mobile app.

## Technologies

The whole app will be formed by three main parts with the following technologies:

  - Mobile app - Ionic framework
  - API REST - Spring framework
  - Data base - MongoDB
